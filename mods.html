			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/FakeModerator" target="_blank">Fake Moderator</a></h1>
			<p>A pretty simple Geode mod that gives you a Mod badge, a "working" REQ button, and a "working" mod suggest stars button. Currently there's only a regular mod option but in the future I'm gonna add an option for elder mod aswell and possibly comment coloring.</p>

		<div class="mod">
			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/VoiceInput" target="_blank">VoiceInput</a></h1>
			<p>This program basically just detects voice input and holds down left click while it's detected. It has an adjustable sensitivity stored in the holy .john file and yeah that's really it. It's really fun to try and play games with but I wouldn't try to use it on games with an anticheat cuz like who knows how that might go.</p>

		<div class="mod">
			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/2.2-Noclip" target="_blank">2.2 Noclip (NO LONGER WORKING)</a></h1>
			<p>!NOT CURRENTLY WORKING! Quick easy noclip mod for 2.2, no longer works in any later version. This was made before Mega Hack came out and will no longer be updated, but the code is still there if anyone wants to check it out.</p>
