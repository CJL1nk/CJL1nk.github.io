			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/VoiceDash" target="_blank">VoiceDash</a></h1>

			<p>This mod allows you to play GD with your voice. All you need is Mega Hack, where you'll move the main DLL to the extensions folder, move the portaudio DLL into the game's directory, then start game and boom. It has an adjustable audio threshold to help with sensitivity and all that which is pretty cool I think. It technically works with other games too but I wouldn't try it if it has an anticheat. </p>

			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/2.2-Noclip" target="_blank">2.2 Noclip (NO LONGER WORKING)</a></h1>

			<p>Quick easy noclip mod for 2.2, no longer works in any later version. This was made before Mega Hack came out and will no longer be updated, but the code is still there if anyone wants to check it out.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/SpaceUK-Simulator" target="_blank">SpaceUK Simulator</a></h1>

			<p>First ever GD mod I made, complete with really messed up code and most of it being in the header file. IDK how I got this to work but I did and it has a few mods like noclip and a macro replaying bot, which is probably the only useful thing in there. It originally was a command line mod menu but I updated it to be a Mega Hack Extension.</p>
