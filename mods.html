			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/VoiceDash" target="_blank">VoiceDash</a></h1>
			<p>!NOT CURRENTLY WORKING! This mod allows you to play GD with your voice. All you need is Mega Hack, where you'll move the main DLL to the extensions folder, move the portaudio DLL into the game's directory, then start game and boom. It has an adjustable audio threshold to help with sensitivity and all that which is pretty cool I think. It technically kinda works with other games too but I wouldn't try it if it has an anticheat.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://github.com/CJL1nk/2.2-Noclip" target="_blank">2.2 Noclip (NO LONGER WORKING)</a></h1>
			<p>!NOT CURRENTLY WORKING! Quick easy noclip mod for 2.2, no longer works in any later version. This was made before Mega Hack came out and will no longer be updated, but the code is still there if anyone wants to check it out.</p>
